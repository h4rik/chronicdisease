              <li><b>DIABETES :</b></li>
              <p>-->Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.

                <p>-->Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy.</p>
                
                <p>-->With diabetes, your body doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use it as well as it should. When there isn’t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.</p>
              <h4>Types of diabetes :</h4>
              <p>1.Type - 1</p>
            
              <p>If you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas doesn’t make insulin or makes very little insulin. Insulin helps blood sugar enter the cells in your body for use as energy. Without insulin, blood sugar can’t get into cells and builds up in the bloodstream. High blood sugar is damaging to the body and causes many of the symptoms and complications of diabetes.</p>

                <p>Type 1 diabetes was once called insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes. It usually develops in children, teens, and young adults, but it can happen at any age.</p>
                
                <p>Type 1 diabetes is less common than type 2—about 5-10% of people with diabetes have type 1. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes, but it can be treated successfully by:</p>
                
                <p>Following your doctor’s recommendations for living a healthy lifestyle.</p>
                <p>1.Managing your blood sugar.</p>
                <p>2.Getting regular health checkups.</p>
                <p>3.Getting diabetes self-management education and support.</p>
            <p>2.Type - 2</p>

            <p>More than 37 million Americans have diabetes (about 1 in 10), and approximately 90-95% of them have type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes most often develops in people over age 45, but more and more children, teens, and young adults are also developing it.</p>

            <p>-->Insulin is a key player in developing type 2 diabetes. This vital hormone—you can’t survive without it—regulates blood sugar (glucose) in the body, a very complicated process. Here are the high points:

              <p>-->The food you eat is broken down into blood sugar,Blood sugar enters your bloodstream, which signals the pancreas to release insulin.</p>

              <p>-->Insulin helps blood sugar enter the body’s cells so it can be used for energy,Insulin also signals the liver to store blood sugar for later use.</p>

              <p>Blood sugar enters cells, and levels in the bloodstream decrease, signaling insulin to decrease too,Lower insulin levels alert the liver to release stored blood sugar so energy is always available, even if you haven’t eaten for a while.</p>
          </p>
              <li>Cancer</li>
                <p>Cancer refers to any one of a large number of diseases characterized by the development of abnormal cells that divide uncontrollably and have the ability to infiltrate and destroy normal body tissue. Cancer often has the ability to spread throughout your body. Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the world.</p>
                <p>Types of Cancers :</p>
                  <p>->Lung cancer</p>
                  <p>->Kidney cancer</p>
                  <p>->Breast cancer</p>
                  <p>Now let us see details about each cancer disease</p>
                  <p>1.Lung Cancer </p>
                  <p>-->Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs. Your lungs are two spongy organs in your chest that take in oxygen when you inhale and release carbon dioxide when you exhale.</p>
                  <p>-->Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.</p>                        
                  <p>-->People who smoke have the greatest risk of lung cancer, though lung cancer can also occur in people who have never smoked. The risk of lung cancer increases with the length of time and number of cigarettes you've smoked. If you quit smoking, even after smoking for many years, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing lung cancer.</p>
                  <p>2.Kidney cancer</p>
                  <p>-->Kidney cancer is cancer that begins in the kidneys. Your kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of your fist. They're located behind your abdominal organs, with one kidney on each side of your spine.    
                  <p>-->In adults, renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer. Other less common types of kidney cancer can occur. Young children are more likely to develop a kind of kidney cancer called Wilms' tumor.</p>
                  <p>-->The incidence of kidney cancer seems to be increasing. One reason for this may be the fact that imaging techniques such as computerized tomography (CT) scans are being used more often. These tests may lead to the accidental discovery of more kidney cancers. Kidney cancer is often discovered at an early stage, when the cancer is small and confined to the kidney</p>
                  <p>3.Breast cancer</p>
                  <p>-->Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts.</p>
                  <p>-->After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.</p>
                  <p>-->Substantial support for breast cancer awareness and research funding has helped create advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Breast cancer survival rates have increased, and the number of deaths associated with this disease is steadily declining, largely due to factors such as earlier detection, a new personalized approach to treatment and a better understanding of the disease</p>
            <li>Arthritis</li>
                <p>-->Arthritis is the swelling and tenderness of one or more joints. The main symptoms of arthritis are joint pain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age. The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
                <p>-->Osteoarthritis causes cartilage — the hard, slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they form a joint — to break down. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the immune system attacks the joints, beginning with the lining of joints.</p>
                <p>-->Uric acid crystals, which form when there's too much uric acid in your blood, can cause gout. Infections or underlying disease, such as psoriasis or lupus, can cause other types of arthritis.</p>
                <p>-->Treatments vary depending on the type of arthritis. The main goals of arthritis treatments are to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life</p>
                <p>Types of Arthritis</p>
                    <p>1.Osteoarthritis.</p>
                        <p>-->Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. Some people call it degenerative joint disease or “wear and tear” arthritis. It occurs most frequently in the hands, hips, and knees.</p>
                    <p>2.Rheumatoid Arthritis.</p>
                        <p>-->Rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease, which means that your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake, causing inflammation (painful swelling) in the affected parts of the body.</p>
                    <p>3.Gout.</p>
                        <p>-->Gout is a common form of inflammatory arthritis that is very painful. It usually affects one joint at a time (often the big toe joint). There are times when symptoms get worse, known as flares, and times when there are no symptoms, known as remission. Repeated bouts of gout can lead to gouty arthritis, a worsening form of arthritis.</p>
                    <p>4.Fibromyalgia.</p>
                        <p>-->Fibromyalgia (fi·bro·my·al·gi·a) is a condition that causes pain all over the body (also referred to as widespread pain), sleep problems, fatigue, and often emotional and mental distress.</p>
                    <p>5.Childhood Arthritis<p>
                        <p>Arthritis in children is called childhood arthritis or juvenile arthritis. The most common type of childhood arthritis is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), also known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
            <li>Heart disease<li>
                <p>-->The term “heart disease” refers to several types of heart conditions. The most common type of heart disease in the United States is coronary artery disease (CAD), which affects the blood flow to the heart. Decreased blood flow can cause a heart attack.</p>
                <p>-->The causes of heart disease depend on the type of disease. Some possible causes include lifestyle, genetics, infections, medicines, and other diseases.</p>
                <p>Types of heart diseases</p>
                    <p>1.Angina</p>
                        <P>-->Chest pain from lack of blood flow</P>
                    <p>2.Heart attacks</p>
                        <p>-->When part of the heart muscle dies from loss of blood flow</p>
                    <p>3.Heart failure</p> 
                        <p>-->When your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs</p>
                    <p>4.Arrhythmia</p> 
                        <p>-->A problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat</p>
